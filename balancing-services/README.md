An agent plugin for working with European electricity balancing markets.

## Skills

### Balancing Services API

Query European electricity balancing market data — imbalance prices, balancing energy, capacity bids, and more — using the [Balancing Services CLI](https://pypi.org/project/balancing-services-cli/). Claude automatically activates this skill when you ask about balancing market data.

**Example prompts:**

- "What were imbalance prices in Estonia yesterday?"
- "Show me activated mFRR energy in Germany last week"
- "Compare aFRR capacity prices between France and Netherlands for January 2025"
- "Download energy bids for Finland as Parquet"
